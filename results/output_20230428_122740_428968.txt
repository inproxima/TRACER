 The four main themes that emerged from the conversation with regards to Math Minds are: 
1. Breaking down lessons into micro-lessons: The teacher discussed the importance of breaking down lessons into smaller, more manageable parts in order to ensure that students are understanding the material. This allows for more effective assessment and better understanding of the material. 
2. Constant assessment: The teacher discussed the importance of constantly assessing students in order to ensure that they are understanding the material. This allows for more effective teaching and better understanding of the material. 
3. Visual reminders: The teacher discussed the importance of using visual reminders such as sticky notes and pencils to help keep track of the material and to ensure that students are understanding the material. 
4. The need for abstract thinking: The teacher discussed how the students struggled with abstract thinking, and how they needed guidance to be able to understand the material. 

These four themes were selected because they are the most frequently discussed topics in the conversation between the researcher and the teacher. They are also the most important topics for teaching mathematics, as they are essential for ensuring that students are understanding the material and are able to apply it in their own learning.
