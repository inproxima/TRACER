Based on the content provided, the four most frequent and central aspects related to teaching and assessment are:

1. Breaking Down Tasks into Smaller Steps
2. Constant Assessment
3. The Need for Support
4. The Importance of Language in Teaching Mathematics

Breaking down tasks into smaller steps is a crucial aspect of teaching, especially in subjects like mathematics where concepts can be complex and difficult to understand. By breaking tasks down into smaller steps, students are more likely to grasp the concepts and be successful. Constant assessment is also important in order to ensure that students are understanding the concepts and making progress. This includes both formative and summative assessments. Teachers need support in order to be successful in teaching mathematics, whether it be through professional development opportunities or access to additional resources. Lastly, the importance of language in teaching mathematics cannot be overstated. Consistent language is necessary for students to understand the concepts and make connections between different grades.

Overall, these themes highlight the importance of effective teaching and assessment practices, and the need for educators to have the necessary tools and support to help their students succeed.
