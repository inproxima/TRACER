 The four main themes that emerged from the conversation with regards to Math Minds are: 
1. The importance of breaking down concepts into smaller steps and providing clear instructions - this allows for more effective assessment and better understanding of the material. 
2. The need to assess student understanding in order to identify gaps in knowledge - this allows for more effective teaching and better understanding of the material. 
3. The importance of providing students with opportunities to experience success in order to foster a positive attitude towards Math - this helps to motivate students and encourages them to take ownership of their learning. 
4. The need to use experiences from the current year to inform teaching strategies for the next year, as well as providing students with material from lower grades to ensure success - this allows for more effective teaching and better understanding of the material.
