After analyzing the provided themes, the four most frequent and central aspects related to teaching and assessment are:

1. Breaking down tasks into micro lessons: This theme appears in three of the five transcripts and emphasizes the importance of breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces to ensure student understanding. This approach is particularly important in mathematics education, where complex problems can be overwhelming for students. By breaking down tasks into smaller steps, teachers can ensure that students are able to understand and master each concept before moving on to more complex material.

2. Constant assessment: This theme also appears in three of the five transcripts and highlights the importance of constantly assessing students to track their progress and ensure that they are understanding the material. By using a variety of assessment methods, including mini whiteboards and workbooks, teachers can gain a better understanding of each student's strengths and weaknesses and adjust their teaching accordingly.

3. Intrinsic motivation: This theme appears in two of the five transcripts and emphasizes the importance of intrinsic motivation in teaching mathematics. Teachers must be aware that some students may need extra motivation to succeed and provide the necessary support to help them achieve their goals.

4. Support: This theme also appears in two of the five transcripts and underscores the importance of having support in order to be successful in teaching mathematics. This includes having extra bodies in the classroom, such as student teachers, and utilizing lesson studies to evaluate teaching methods and identify areas for improvement.

Overall, these themes highlight the importance of a student-centered approach to teaching mathematics, where teachers prioritize student understanding, assess progress regularly, and provide support and motivation to help students succeed. By breaking down tasks into smaller steps, constantly assessing student progress, and providing the necessary support, teachers can help all students achieve their full potential in mathematics.
