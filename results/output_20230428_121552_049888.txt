 The four main themes that emerged from the conversation with regards to Math Minds are: 
1. The importance of breaking down concepts into microsteps: The teacher discussed how breaking down concepts into microsteps has been beneficial for her students, as it allows them to review or learn for the first time and move through those steps together as a collective class. This has also enabled her to assess her students more often, which has saved her time from having to re-teach lessons.
2. The need for teachers to have a strong understanding of mathematics and the ability to unpack and provide answers. 
3. The importance of creating a lesson structure that encourages students to discover and explore together. 
4. The need to assess student understanding and address any gaps in knowledge.
