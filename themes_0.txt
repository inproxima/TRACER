The four main themes that emerged from the conversation are: 

1. The importance of foundational knowledge: The conversation highlighted the importance of having a strong foundation in mathematics in order to be successful in the field. It was also noted that mathematicians engage with foundational knowledge differently than teachers, as they are focused on creating rather than providing answers.

2. The need for a balance between arithmetics and mathematics: The conversation highlighted the need for a balance between arithmetics and mathematics in order to be successful in teaching mathematics. It was noted that while arithmetics is important, it is not the focus of mathematics.

3. The importance of intrinsic motivation: The conversation highlighted the importance of intrinsic motivation in order to be successful in teaching mathematics. It was noted that some students may need extra motivation in order to be successful, and that teachers need to be aware of this in order to create an environment that encourages learning.

4. The need for support: The conversation highlighted the need for support in order to be successful in teaching mathematics. It was noted that having extra bodies in the classroom can be helpful, as well as having a lesson study in order to increase self-awareness and teaching style. Additionally, it was noted that having student teachers

1. Breaking Down Tasks into Micro Lessons: This theme focuses on the importance of breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces in order to ensure that students understand the material. This includes breaking down math problems into smaller steps, breaking down art projects into smaller steps, and breaking down language arts tasks into smaller steps.

2. Constant Assessment: This theme focuses on the importance of constantly assessing students in order to ensure that they are understanding the material. This includes using mini whiteboards, workbooks, and other methods of assessment to track student progress.

3. Visual Reminders: This theme focuses on the importance of providing visual reminders to teachers in order to help them track their progress through the program. This includes using sticky notes, pencils, and other methods of tracking progress.

4. Aligning Curriculum with Workbooks: This theme focuses on the importance of aligning curriculum with workbooks in order to ensure that students are getting the most out of the material. This includes cross-referencing the curriculum with the workbook and making sure that the slides are accurate.


The four main themes that emerge from the conversation are:

1. Comfort with Teaching: The teacher expresses that they are becoming more comfortable with teaching and less reliant on the Smartboard lessons. They are also becoming more comfortable with assessing the students and knowing when to move on or when to skip a lesson.

2. Balance between Curriculum and Time: The teacher expresses the struggle of finding a balance between getting through the curriculum and allowing enough time for the students to understand the material.

3. Principles for Prompting Success: The teacher discusses the principles for prompting success, such as microsteps, frequent assessment and feedback, the use of bonus questions, and attention to mental math. They find some of these principles helpful, while others are more restrictive or difficult.

4. Abstract Thinking: The teacher discusses the need for more abstract thinking in the JUMP Math program, as the students struggle with more complex problems that require multiple steps and more abstract thinking. They suggest that the program should provide more opportunities for abstract thinking and problem solving. The teacher also finds that the whole philosophy of the program and the principles have helped them to understand why they are doing what they are doing, and to explain to parents the direction of the program. Being observed


The four main themes that emerge from the conversation are: 

1. The importance of frequent assessment: The teacher emphasizes the importance of frequent assessment in order to gauge student understanding and adjust the lesson accordingly. This includes the use of bonus questions, attention to mental math, and the use of strategies such as thumbs up/down and whiteboards.

2. The need for improvisation: The teacher discusses the need to improvise in order to better explain concepts to students and ensure that they understand the material. This includes re-explaining concepts in different ways, skipping slides if the students are picking up the material quickly, and providing movement breaks when needed.

3. The value of microsteps: The teacher explains how breaking down concepts into microsteps can be beneficial for all students, regardless of their level of understanding. This allows for a more even playing field and ensures that all students are able to understand the material.

4. The impact of JUMP Math: The teacher discusses how JUMP Math has impacted their teaching, including the ability to assess student understanding more often and the breaking down of concepts into microsteps. The teacher also notes the positive feedback they have received from students and their genuine interest in helping students understand the material.


The four main themes that emerge from the conversation are: 
1) Comfort Level: The teacher expresses the importance of increasing their comfort level with having people in the classroom, speaking up if they are uncomfortable with something, and using their experiences to shape their teaching for the next year. 
2) Instructional Strategies: The teacher emphasizes the importance of breaking down instructions into smaller steps, providing clear instructions, and assessing on the spot. 
3) Student Success: The teacher discusses the importance of students experiencing success in order to want to do something, and the need for public success in order to motivate students. They also note the importance of providing praise and breaking down instructions into smaller steps to ensure that all students can find success. 
4) Reflection: The teacher reflects on their own teaching, noting the lessons that didn't go as well as hoped, the lessons they are excited to try again next year, and their goals for improving their teaching of Math. They also express their satisfaction with the JUMP program and the success that it has brought to their classroom.
