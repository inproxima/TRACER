The four main themes that emerged from the conversation are: 

1. The importance of foundational knowledge: The conversation highlighted the importance of having a strong foundation in mathematics in order to be successful in the field. It was also noted that mathematicians engage with foundational knowledge differently than teachers, as they are focused on creating rather than providing answers.

2. The need for a balance between arithmetics and mathematics: The conversation highlighted the need for a balance between arithmetics and mathematics in order to be successful in teaching mathematics. It was noted that while arithmetics is important, it is not the focus of mathematics.

3. The importance of intrinsic motivation: The conversation highlighted the importance of intrinsic motivation in order to be successful in teaching mathematics. It was noted that some students may need extra motivation in order to be successful, and that teachers need to be aware of this in order to create an environment that encourages learning.

4. The need for support: The conversation highlighted the need for support in order to be successful in teaching mathematics. It was noted that having extra bodies in the classroom can be helpful, as well as having student teachers who are knowledgeable in the field. Additionally, it was noted that having a lesson study can be beneficial in

1. Breaking Down Tasks into Micro Lessons: This theme focuses on the importance of breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces in order to ensure that students understand the material. This includes breaking down math problems into smaller steps, breaking down art projects into smaller steps, and breaking down language arts tasks into smaller steps.

2. Constant Assessment: This theme focuses on the importance of constantly assessing students in order to ensure that they are understanding the material. This includes using mini whiteboards, workbooks, and other methods of assessment to track student progress.

3. Visual Reminders: This theme focuses on the importance of providing visual reminders to teachers in order to help them track their progress through the program. This includes using sticky notes, pencils, and other methods of tracking progress.

4. Teacher Preparation: This theme focuses on the importance of teachers being prepared for their lessons. This includes cross-referencing the curriculum with their own workbooks, previewing slides for lessons, and being critical of the slides.


The four main themes that emerge from the conversation are:

1. Comfort with Teaching: The teacher expresses that they are becoming more comfortable with teaching and less reliant on the Smartboard lessons. They are also becoming more comfortable with assessing the students and knowing when to move on or when to skip a lesson. They also find the whole philosophy of the program and the principles helpful in understanding why they are doing what they are doing and in explaining the direction of the program to parents.

2. Time Management: The teacher expresses that they are struggling with the time component of teaching and finding a balance between getting through the curriculum and allowing the students to work through the material.

3. Microsteps and Bonus Questions: The teacher expresses that they find the microsteps and bonus questions helpful, but also restrictive and difficult. They find that the microsteps are invaluable for assessing the students quickly and moving along, but they struggle with finding bonus questions that engage the students without taking away from the students who need extra help.

4. Abstract Thinking: The teacher expresses that they find the JUMP Math program does an excellent job in teaching the microsteps and developing a concrete understanding of math, but they feel that there needs to be more attention to abstract thinking to take


The four main themes that emerge from the conversation are: 

1. Microsteps: The importance of breaking down mathematical concepts into small, manageable steps in order to ensure that all students are able to understand the material. This includes frequent assessment, the use of bonus questions, and attention to mental math.

2. Improvising: The need for teachers to be flexible and able to adjust their teaching methods in order to better meet the needs of their students. This includes being able to explain concepts in different ways, using manipulatives, and creating questions on their own.

3. Engagement: The importance of engaging students in the learning process in order to ensure that they are able to understand the material. This includes using strategies such as whiteboards, thumbs up/down, and fingers up against their chest.

4. Gaps in Understanding: The need for teachers to be aware of their own gaps in understanding in order to be able to effectively teach a particular concept or respond to studentsâ€™ questions. This includes being able to identify when students are not understanding the material and being able to adjust the lesson accordingly, as well as having a genuine interest in their learning and understanding of the material.


The four main themes that emerge from the conversation are: 
1) Comfort Level: The teacher expresses the importance of increasing their comfort level with having people in the classroom, speaking up if they are uncomfortable with something, and using their experiences to shape their teaching for the next year. 
2) Breaking Down Steps: The teacher emphasizes the importance of breaking down steps into smaller parts in order to ensure that students understand the material, and calling on students who don't typically have their hands up.
3) Public Success: The teacher discusses the importance of public success in order for students to experience success and want to continue doing Math. 
4) Diverse Learners: The teacher talks about the importance of recognizing the diverse range of learners in the classroom and providing them with the support they need to be successful, such as pulling material from lower grades if needed.
