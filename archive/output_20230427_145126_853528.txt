 The four themes that repeat most frequently are: 1) Breaking down concepts into smaller steps to ensure all students understand the material, 2) The use of strategies such as whiteboards and thumbs up/down to assess student understanding, 3) The need to improvise in order to meet the needs of all students, and 4) The impact of the JUMP Math program on the teacher's ability to assess student understanding, adapt lessons accordingly, and provide genuine interest in their success. This is supported by the fact that all four of these themes are mentioned in all three pieces of context.
