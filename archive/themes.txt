The four main themes that emerged from the conversation with regards to Math Minds are: 
1) Breaking down lessons into micro-lessons: The teacher discussed the importance of breaking down lessons into smaller, more manageable parts in order to ensure that students are understanding the material. This allows for more effective assessment and allows teachers to identify any areas where students may be struggling. 
2) Constant assessment: The teacher discussed the importance of constantly assessing students in order to ensure that they are understanding the material. This allows teachers to identify any areas where students may be struggling and to provide additional support. 
3) Visual reminders: The teacher discussed the importance of using visual reminders, such as sticky notes, to help keep track of the material that has been covered and to provide a visual reminder of what needs to be done. 
4) Cross-referencing: The teacher discussed the importance of cross-referencing the curriculum with the workbook in order to ensure that all material is being covered and to provide a visual reminder of what needs to be done.


The four main themes that emerged from the conversation with regards to Math Minds are: 
1. The importance of microsteps, frequent assessment and feedback, the use of bonus questions, and attention to mental Math. 
2. The need to adapt the content to the level of abstraction and the number of steps. 
3. The need to develop general tools for problem solving. 
4. The need for self-awareness, comfort in teaching, and being observed outside of one's comfort zone.


The four main themes that emerged from the conversation with regards to Math Minds are: 
1. The importance of breaking down concepts into smaller steps and providing clear instructions. 
2. The need to assess student understanding and address any gaps in knowledge. 
3. The importance of creating an environment of success and confidence in the classroom, including providing praise and breaking down concepts further when needed. 
4. The need to use experiences from the current year to shape teaching for the next year, and the success of the JUMP program in helping students of all abilities find success.


The four main themes that emerged from the conversation between the researcher and the teacher about the Math Minds Methods of teaching mathematics are: 
1. The importance of foundational knowledge in mathematics: The teacher discussed the importance of having a strong foundation in mathematics in order to be able to process and understand more complex concepts. The researcher also discussed the different ways in which mathematicians and teachers engage with foundational knowledge. 
2. The need for a balance between arithmetics and mathematics: The teacher discussed the need for a balance between arithmetics and mathematics, and the need to understand the differences between the two. 
3. The importance of intrinsic motivation: The teacher discussed the difficulty of getting students to care about mathematics and the need to find ways to motivate them intrinsically. 
4. The need for support and resources: The teacher discussed the need for more time and resources to be able to teach mathematics effectively, as well as the need for student teachers to be better prepared and supported.


The four main themes that emerged from the conversation with regards to Math Minds are: 

1. The importance of breaking down concepts into microsteps: The teacher discussed how breaking down concepts into microsteps has been beneficial for her students, as it allows them to review or learn for the first time and move through those steps together as a collective class. This has also enabled her to assess her students more often, which has saved her time from having to re-teach lessons. 

2. The use of strategies to engage students: The teacher discussed how she has been using strategies such as whiteboards, thumbs up/thumbs down, and the number of fingers on their chest to engage her students and get answers from all of them. This has been a big change for her, as she was not getting answers from all 18 of her students last year. 

3. The importance of frequent assessment: The teacher discussed how frequent assessment has been helpful in building upon knowledge, as it ensures that everyone has been taught the most basic of concepts. This has also enabled her to better gauge if her students are comprehending the lesson, setting them up for better success when theyâ€™re doing their worksheets.

The four main themes that emerged from the conversation about Math Minds are: 
1) Building Connections: The teacher discussed the importance of building a connection with the students in order to create a trusting relationship and to help them feel confident in their abilities. 
2) Instantaneous Feedback and Assessment: The teacher discussed the importance of providing instantaneous feedback and assessment to help students understand and learn from their mistakes. 
3) Humour and Silliness: The teacher discussed the use of humour and silliness to help engage students and to help them become more confident in their abilities. 
4) Going Deeper into the Resource: The teacher discussed the importance of going deeper into the JUMP Math resource in order to find different activities and to stretch the students.
