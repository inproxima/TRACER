 The four themes that repeat most frequently are 1) breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable steps, 2) constant assessment, 3) visual reminders, and 4) the importance of being comfortable with the program in order to teach more naturally. These themes are supported by the participant's discussion of breaking down tasks into smaller steps, the use of mini whiteboards and workbooks to assess student progress, the use of sticky notes to help teachers keep track of their progress, and the need to become more comfortable with the program in order to teach more naturally.
